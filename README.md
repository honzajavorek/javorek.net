# javorek.net

Source code of portfilio site of my former business. Result can be seen on [javorek.net](http://www.javorek.net).

Couple of years ago, I formed a small web development team with [Michal Wiglasz](https://github.com/kacer) and some external designers. It used **javorek.net** or just **Javorek** as it's brand name and we used [javorek.net](http://www.javorek.net) as our portfolio site. As this business activity doesn't exist any more, the site only serves as a tombstone now.
